# Magic Manuscript Maker Typesetting Workflow (under construction)
The Magic Manuscript Maker Typesetting Workflow is a collection of open-source tools and scripts that help to automate the typesetting process of academic articles. The workflow is designed to be used in a Docker container and is part of the [Philosophy and the Mind Sciences](https://philosophymindscience.org/) journal. The workflow consists of the following tools:

- [XML2YAML-OS](https://github.com/phimisci/xml2yaml-os)
- [Typesetting-Container-OS](https://github.com/phimisci/typesetting-container-os)
- [DOC2MD-OS](https://github.com/phimisci/doc2md-os)
- [VerifyBibTeX-OS](https://github.com/phimisci/verifybibtex-os)

These tools are channeled through a web application called the "Magic Manuscript Maker", which allows to create user profiles and projects. The web application will be released in the future.
